# HackyBird

### Prerequires:

- <a href="https://www.cheatengine.org/" rel="nofollow">Cheat Engine</a>

-----------------

- So for the first step let's open Cheat Engine and put a hotkey for pause the process.

- Go into ``Edit -> Settings -> Hotkeys -> Pause the selected process``, you can put a random Hotkey, personnatly I will put ``Q``, press ok.

- Now open HackyBird.exe, go back to Cheat Engine and on the top left select ``Flappy101``.

- So go on the game and play the game to earn 1 point, after it pause the program and make a first scan with the value: ``1`` (corresponding to the score).

- Go back to the game and unpause it and earn a second points, and do a ``Next Scan`` (not New Scan), with the value: ``2`` (also corresponding to the score).

- So take the all addresses of the Next Scan (CTRL + A) and right click on it and click on ``Add selected addresses to the addresslist``.

- After that, you will see the addresses at the bottom, double click on every value and change it to 999 (I put 999 because generally it's the value you have to get for win), go back to the game, unpause it and earn a 3rd points for going to 1000 points and you will have the flag:
